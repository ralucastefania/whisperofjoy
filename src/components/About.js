        <p>
          I’m just a girl in search of herself and her happyness. I am born in
          Romania, but since 2015 I live in Germany and still don’t know if this
          is my forever home. I dream to travel the world and make as many great
          memories as possible, but not because we leave only once or because
          life is short. It's simply the way I saw myself live the life I was
          given ever since I was a child.
