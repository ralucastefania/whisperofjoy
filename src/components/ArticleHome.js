          <h2>First letter</h2>
          <p>
            I am writing you as our encounter this morning has been a bit
            unpleasant for me. First of all let me apologise for taking you by
            surprise with my enthusiasm. I really did not think it would scare
            you that much and make you hit me like that. I mean, my cheek still
            feels a bit funny from your claws. Second of all, let me assure you
            of my friendship and good intentions. You are more than welcomed to
            cross my humansâ€™ terrace anytime you wanna take your rounds around
            the neighbourhood. An answer from you would make my tail wiggle of
            extreme happiness. Big hugs, S.
